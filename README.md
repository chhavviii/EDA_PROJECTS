# DATA ANALYSIS & MACHINE LEARNING MODELS OF KAGGLE DATASETS
# This repository contains various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects on different datasets. The goal of these analyses is to extract insights, detect patterns, and understand the underlying structure of the data. Each dataset has been processed using statistical summaries, visualizations, and feature analysis techniques.
